                On February 13th, the Spartan community tragically lost 3 of its members and witnessed 5 other students gravely injured. As a result,
                the trajectories of Michigan State University, its students, staff, faculty, and families have been changed forever. Although we may
                be grieving and dealing with these events in our own ways, now is the time for Spartans to come together and show the world our 
                resilience and strength. We show this strength through supporting our fellow community members, spreading love when those around us
                need it the most, and demanding change when the barriers to change seem insurmountable.
            </p>
            <p>We ask you to please remember these Spartans:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arielle Anderson</li>
                <li>Alexandria Verner</li>
                <li>Brian Fraser</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are all Spartan Strong</p>
